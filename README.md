## Project Overview üöÄ

This repository is a robust template for working with SQL files, primarily oriented towards PostgreSQL.
It comes equipped with tools for code formatting and linting, spell checking, a ready-to-use devcontainer,
custom VS Code settings, essential repository files, automated releasing,
and extensive documentation to support effective project management and customization.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Devcontainer:**
  Provides an Ubuntu-based environment with Python and Node support, custom VS Code settings and extensions,
  and a local PostgreSQL service.
- **Formatting:**
  Ensures a consistent code style using Prettier, EditorConfig, markdownlint, and SQLFluff for SQL files.
- **Spell Checking:**
  Automatically highlights spelling errors.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:**
  Automates quality checks before each commit.
- **Release Automation:**
  Manages releases automatically.
- **Dependency Updates Automation:**
  Keeps dependencies up-to-date via Dependabot.

## Installation üì¶

This setup is designed for **GitHub Codespaces**.
Running locally has **not been tested** and may require additional configuration.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Formatting

Most formatting tasks are automated and enforced using various tools.
Feel free to adjust these settings for your project.
The repository configurations are described in the [`STYLEGUIDE.md`][STYLEGUIDE].

- **SQL Files:**
  The project uses SQLFluff for SQL file formatting.
  SQLFluff automatically formats SQL files in the editor when the following settings are enabled
  (already configured in the devcontainer):

  - `editor.formatOnPaste`: true
  - `editor.formatOnSave`: true
  - `files.autoSave`: onFocusChange

  To check your SQL code, run:

  ```bash
  npm run sqlfluff:check
  ```

  To fix fixable issues, run:

  ```bash
  npm run sqlfluff:write
  ```

- **Prettier-supported Files:**
  Use **Prettier** to format all other files supported by Prettier.

  To apply formatting to your code, run:

  ```bash
  npm run format:write
  ```

  For a formatting check without modifying files, run:

  ```bash
  npm run format:check
  ```

### Spell Checking

To run spell checking, execute:

```bash
npm run spell:check
```

Adjust the `cspell.json` configuration file if needed.
